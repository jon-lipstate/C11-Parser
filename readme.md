# C11 Parser

This is intended to be the basis for a c-bindings generator.

Update: @gingerBill is doing CUIK bindings in the near future, removing the need for this project. Retained as a (partial) example of a recursive descent parser.

State:

-   Tokenizer is tentatively complete
-   Parser: just started on parse_decl
